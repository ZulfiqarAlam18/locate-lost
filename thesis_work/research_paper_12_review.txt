# Research Paper 12 Review

## Review
Research Paper 12 introduces a social media-based approach to locating missing persons. The system leverages existing social networks to disseminate information about missing individuals quickly and widely. It implements a web crawler that monitors social media platforms for posts containing keywords related to missing persons and uses natural language processing to extract relevant information.

The paper demonstrates how crowdsourcing can significantly expand the reach of missing person alerts compared to traditional methods. The authors developed a web platform that allows users to create and share missing person reports across multiple social media channels simultaneously. The system also includes a verification mechanism to reduce false reports and a prioritization algorithm based on vulnerability factors of the missing person.

While innovative in its approach to utilizing social networks, the system lacks sophisticated image processing capabilities, relying primarily on text-based information sharing and manual visual identification by users.

## Limitations
1. Minimal image processing capabilities, with no automated facial recognition
2. Vulnerable to misinformation and false reporting
3. Effectiveness depends heavily on social media engagement
4. Limited verification mechanisms for found person claims
5. No structured data collection for missing person characteristics
6. Privacy concerns regarding public sharing of personal information
7. No mobile application, limiting accessibility on-the-go
8. Difficult to maintain long-term tracking of cases
9. No integration with law enforcement databases
10. Lacks analytical tools to identify patterns in missing person cases

## How LocateLost Differs
LocateLost offers significant improvements over the system described in Research Paper 12:

1. Advanced Facial Recognition: Unlike Paper 12's text-based approach, LocateLost employs sophisticated facial recognition technology to automate the matching process.

2. Structured Data Collection: LocateLost provides standardized forms for reporting missing persons, ensuring comprehensive and consistent information gathering.

3. Mobile Application: LocateLost is built as a mobile application, making it more accessible than Paper 12's web-only platform.

4. Privacy Controls: LocateLost implements stronger privacy measures, processing data only for matching purposes rather than broadcasting personal information publicly.

5. Verification System: LocateLost has more robust verification mechanisms for both missing person reports and found person claims.

6. Integrated Approach: While leveraging the power of community involvement, LocateLost also incorporates technological solutions for more reliable matching.

7. Dedicated Platform: Rather than relying on existing social media platforms with their limitations, LocateLost provides a dedicated environment optimized for missing person cases.

8. Emergency Features: LocateLost includes emergency contact functionality not present in Paper 12's system.

9. Statistical Analysis: LocateLost offers statistical insights into missing person cases, helping to identify patterns and improve system effectiveness.
