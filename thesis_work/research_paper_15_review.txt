# Research Paper 15 Review

## Review
Research Paper 15 investigates a hybrid approach to missing person identification that combines traditional community-based search methods with modern technological solutions. The authors developed a system that integrates social media alerts, volunteer coordination tools, and basic image matching capabilities. The paper emphasizes the importance of human networks in missing person cases, particularly in communities with limited technological infrastructure.

The system described includes a web platform and basic mobile application that allows families to create missing person reports, coordinate search efforts, and disseminate information through both digital and non-digital channels. A notable feature is the offline functionality that enables the application to work in areas with intermittent internet connectivity, storing data locally and synchronizing when connection is restored.

While the paper presents a pragmatic approach to missing person cases, the technological components are relatively basic compared to more advanced systems. The image matching relies on manual review rather than automated facial recognition, and the coordination tools lack sophisticated features for large-scale operations.

## Limitations
1. Basic image matching capabilities without advanced facial recognition
2. Limited scalability for handling large numbers of cases simultaneously
3. Minimal data analytics for identifying patterns or optimizing search efforts
4. Rudimentary mobile application with limited functionality
5. Manual verification processes creating potential bottlenecks
6. Insufficient security measures for protecting sensitive personal information
7. Challenges in maintaining volunteer engagement over time
8. Limited integration with law enforcement systems
9. Minimal resources for addressing psychological aspects of missing person cases
10. Lack of standardized protocols for case management
11. Inconsistent user experience across different platforms
12. Difficulties in measuring effectiveness and outcomes
